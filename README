NAME
    Gtk2::GladeXML::OO - Drop-in replacement for Gtk2::GladeXML with
    AUTOLOAD for objects and object oriented interface to Glade.

SYNOPSIS
            use Gtk2::GladeXML::OO;
        
            our $gladexml = Gtk2::GladeXML::OO->new_from('glade/example.glade');
            $gladexml->signal_autoconnect_from_package('main');

            sub gtk_main_quit { Gtk2->main_quit; }

            # Object _MUST_ be declared as "our"
            our $myobject = MyObject->new();

            Gtk2->main;

            # ...and now callbacks in Glade can be:
            #
            #       myobject->method                <- Gtk2 will pass standard parameters to Your method
            #       myobject->method()              <- without any parameters, ie. window->hide()
            #       myobject->method("param0", "param1")    <- with Your parameters
            #
            #       gtk_main_quit                   <- standard function interface, like before

            # See example.glade and example.pl in example directory!

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides AUTOLOAD function for objects (automagicaly loads
    Your objects) and object oriented interface in Glade callbacks. Now You
    can use in callbacks widgets, Your objects or standard functions like
    before.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
    new_from('/path/to/file.glade')
        This method should be called exactly as "new" in Gtk2::GladeXML (if
        You use "new" in place of "new_from", this package will beheave
        exactly as Gtk2::GladeXML). In example:

                # Gtk2::GladeXML::OO object
                our $gladexml = Gtk2::GladeXML::OO->new_from('glade/example.glade');

                # same as standard Gtk2::GladeXML object!!!
                our $gladexml = Gtk2::GladeXML::OO->new('glade/example.glade');

    $Gtk2::GladeXML::OO::LOG
        Set this variable to true for debug.

DEPENDENCIES
    Gtk2::GladeXML

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    This package will define "AUTOLOAD" function in "main" package. You
    should consider this (little work around?). This will be corrected in
    future versions.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    None known.
