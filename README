NAME
    Gtk2::GladeXML::OO - Drop-in replacement for Gtk2::GladeXML with object
    oriented interface to Glade and AUTOLOAD for all objects.

SYNOPSIS
            use Gtk2::GladeXML::OO;
        
            our $gladexml = Gtk2::GladeXML::OO->new('glade/example.glade');
            $gladexml->signal_autoconnect_from_package('main');

            $gladexml->debug(1);

            sub gtk_main_quit { Gtk2->main_quit; }

            # Object _MUST_ be declared as "our"
            our $myobject = MyObject->new();

            Gtk2->main;

            # ...and now callbacks in Glade can be:
            #
            #       myobject->method                <- Gtk2 will pass standard parameters to Your method
            #       myobject->method()              <- without any parameters, ie. window->hide()
            #       myobject->method("param0", "param1")    <- with Your parameters
            #
            #       gtk_main_quit                   <- standard function interface, like before

            # See example.glade and example.pl in example directory!

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides AUTOLOAD function for objects (automagicaly loads
    Your objects, no action is required on your part) and object-oriented
    interface in Glade callbacks. Now You can use in callbacks: widgets,
    Your objects or standard functions like before. Gtk2::GladeXML::OO is a
    drop-in replacement for Gtk2::GladeXML, so after change from
    Gtk2::GladeXML to Gtk2::GladeXML::OO all Your applications will work
    fine and will have new functionality.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
    new('/path/to/file.glade')
        This method should be called exactly as "new" in Gtk2::GladeXML. In
        example:

                # Gtk2::GladeXML::OO object
                our $gladexml = Gtk2::GladeXML::OO->new('glade/example.glade');

    debug
        This method turns on/off debug. In example:

                # tunrs ON debug
                $gladexml->debug(1);
        
                ...some code...

                # turns OFF debug
                $gledexml->debug(0);

    For all other methods see "Gtk2::GladeXML"!

DEPENDENCIES
    Hook::LexWrap
    Gtk2::GladeXML

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    This package will define "AUTOLOAD" function in "main" package. You
    should consider this (little work around?), when You're using AUTOLOAD
    in Your application (exactly main::AUTOLOAD). This will be corrected in
    future versions.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    None known.
