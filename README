NAME
    Gtk2::GladeXML::OO - Drop-in replacement for Gtk2::GladeXML with
    AUTOLOAD for objects and object oriented interface to Glade.

SYNOPSIS
            use Gtk2::GladeXML::OO;
        
            our $gladexml = Gtk2::GladeXML::OO->new('glade/example.glade');
            $gladexml->signal_autoconnect_from_package('main');

            $gladexml->debug(1);

            sub gtk_main_quit { Gtk2->main_quit; }

            # Object _MUST_ be declared as "our"
            our $myobject = MyObject->new();

            Gtk2->main;

            # ...and now callbacks in Glade can be:
            #
            #       myobject->method                <- Gtk2 will pass standard parameters to Your method
            #       myobject->method()              <- without any parameters, ie. window->hide()
            #       myobject->method("param0", "param1")    <- with Your parameters
            #
            #       gtk_main_quit                   <- standard function interface, like before

            # See example.glade and example.pl in example directory!

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides AUTOLOAD function for objects (automagicaly loads
    Your objects) and object oriented interface in Glade callbacks. Now You
    can use in callbacks widgets, Your objects or standard functions like
    before.

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
    new('/path/to/file.glade')
        This method should be called exactly as "new" in Gtk2::GladeXML. In
        example:

                # Gtk2::GladeXML::OO object
                our $gladexml = Gtk2::GladeXML::OO->new('glade/example.glade');

    debug
        This method turns on/off debug. In example:

                # tunrs ON debug
                $gladexml->debug(1);
        
                ...some code...

                # turns OFF debug
                $gledexml->debug(0);

    For all other methods see "Gtk2::GladeXML"!!!

DEPENDENCIES
    Hook::LexWrap
    Gtk2::GladeXML

INCOMPATIBILITIES
    This package will define "AUTOLOAD" function in "main" package. You
    should consider this (little work around?), when You're using AUTOLOAD.
    This will be corrected in future versions.

BUGS AND LIMITATIONS
    None known.
